# shiro-with-struts-template
Simple template for future projects.  Utilizes struts for MVC and also Shiro for handling authorization.
Used a lot of code from [this project](https://github.com/apache/struts-examples/tree/master/shiro-basic) in order to understand how the Shiro framework works programatically.
